</p><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The game of "dynamic connect-4" is played on a 7x7 grid as follows:
Starting from the initial position illustrated below, players take turns
moving one piece of their colour by one square, either horizontally
or vertically.  White plays first.  Pieces can only move to unoccupied
squares.  
The winner is the first player to line up <b>four</b> of its 
pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

<br>

</p>

<h2> Game Agent</h2>

<p> 
  Implement a game-playing agent to play the game of dynamic
  connect-4. Your agent must be capable of playing
  either white or black. The time limit for your agent to output its
  move is 20 seconds.
  It is strongly suggested that you display the game state using 
  the text representation of a 
  matrix of comma-separated characters, with O denoting a white piece, X
  denoting a black piece, and suitably formatted whitespace denoting an
  empty square.  For example, the starting board configuration above
  would be represented as follows:
</p>

<pre>    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  1  , , , , , ,X
  2 X, , , , , ,O
  3 O, , , , , ,X
  4 X, , , , , ,O
  5 O, , , , , ,X
  6 X, , , , , ,O
  7 O, , , , , ,
</pre>

<p>
  Each square in the grid can be labeled by its &lt;x,y&gt; position,
  with &lt;1,1&gt; corresponding to the top-left square.  Moves are entered 
  by specifying the position of the piece to move in the form &lt;x,y&gt;
  followed by one of the cardinal directions <tt>N, S, E, W</tt>.
</p>

<p> 
For example, to move the black piece at the top right of the board one
square to the left, the command would be <tt>71W</tt>.  These commands
will be exchanged, either with a human opponent or an AI competitor,
through the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/%7Ejer/courses/ai/assignments/gameserver.tgz">game server</a> for which a
sample client is provided in C.  Note that each string sent to the
game server must terminate with a carriage return ("\n"); this is done
to facilitate testing by hand,
e..g., using <tt>telnet &lt;server host address&gt; 12345</tt>. For the
purposes of human-readability, your agent should echo to screen each
of the moves being played.
</p>
<!-- 
     For this part of the assignment you <b>must</b> evaluate game states
     as being either a win (+1), a loss (-1), or a neutral state (0). 
     Implement both the minimax and alpha-beta algorithms. Also, 
  -->

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
  Your program should have an option for specifying the initial game
  state (either through an input file or manually, as you wish). This
  will be used to test your program with specific game scenarios.
</p>

<h2> Suggested Development Strategy</h2>

<p>
Start with minimax, and verify your implementation is working
correctly.  Initially, you should consider only the simple evaluation
function of +1 for a win, -1 for a loss at terminal nodes.  Next,
incorporate alpha-beta pruning to reduce the search space. 
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the simple evaluation function can only make intelligent
moves when its look-ahead horizon detects a sequence leading to a
guaranteed win.  However, since your agent typically won't be able to
search that deep in the tree, it is necessary to cut off the search at
non-terminal nodes, and use a heuristic evaluation function to provide a
meaningful value representing the "goodness" of the corresponding
state.  The quality of your heuristic function will determine how well
your agent plays the game.
</p>



<h2> Additional notes </h2>

<p>
You may program your assignment in any computer language of your
preference, provided it can be compiled and run on the Trottier
Engineering Linux machines (156TRLinux.ece.mcgill.ca). Note that to ensure a "level playing field",
we will use these for the class tournament, so you should tune your
program's search depth to respect the time limit per move (see above)
on these machines. To login, use your McGill UEA
(first.last@mail.mcgill.ca).
</p>

<h2>Report</h2>

<p>
Your report should address the following questions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Consider the three game states shown below:
    <table>
      <tbody><tr>
	  <td>

<pre> , , , , , , 
 , , , , , , 
O, ,X, , , , 
 , , ,O, , ,X
 , , , ,O,X,X
 , ,O, , ,O,X
 , , ,X,O, , 

     (a)
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50">&nbsp;</td>
<td>
<pre>O,O, , , , , 
X, , , , , , 
 , ,X, , ,O, 
 , ,X,O, , ,X
 , , , ,O,X,
 ,X, , , , , 
O, , , , , , 

     (b)
</pre>
</td>
<td width="50">&nbsp;</td>
<td>
<pre> , ,O, ,X, , 
 , ,O, ,X, , 
 , ,X, ,O, , 
 , ,X, ,O, , 
 , , , , , , 
 , ,O, ,X, , 
 , ,X, ,O, , 

     (c)
</pre>
	  </td>
	</tr>
    </tbody></table>

    For each of these configurations, graph the total number of states
    explored by your program when using depth cutoffs of 3, 4, 5 and
    6, both with minimax and alpha-beta. Assume it is white's turn to
    play.    
  </li>

  <li>
    Estimate a formula that relates the depth cutoff to the
    number of states visited for each of minimax and alpha-beta
    algorithms.
  </li>

  <li> Explain whether the number of states explored depends on the
    order in which you generate new states during the search. Justify
    your response using results from your program.
  </li>

  <li> Explain the heuristic evaluation function you used and
    provide a clear rationale for the factors you included.
  </li>

  <li> A more complex evaluation function will increase computation
    time.  Since each move is time constrained, explain whether this
    favours the use of simpler evaluation functions so that your agent
    can evaluate nodes deeper in the game tree.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Submitting your assignment</h2>

<!--
<a name="hardcopy"></a>

<p>
You must submit, at the start of class on the due date, a brief
hardcopy report that explains the design decisions you made and
addresses the items noted above.  Avoid discussion of the
alpha-beta pruning algorithm as you didn't design it and we are
already familiar with it.  Remember that your report is the main
method of communicating what you have accomplished to the reader.
Therefore, make sure that it is well organized and well written; you
will lose marks for spelling errors and poor grammar.  The report
should be a maximum of three pages in length; <em>anything beyond the
three-page limit will not be read</em>.  You are welcome to include
illustrations, such as game state diagrams, to elucidate the text.  A
hardcopy of your source code should be included as an appendix.
-->

<p>Your assignment must be submitted through <a href="http://moodle.cim.mcgill.ca/">moodle</a> to allow for peer- and self-assessment.  The submission must contain:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> a softcopy of your report</li>
  
  <li>
    all of the source code ready to be compiled or interpreted on the
    Trottier Engineering Linux machines
  </li>

  <li>
    a Makefile as relevant 
  </li>
</ul>
